##DESCRIPTION
**fortun** is a unit test framework for Fortran.

##DEVELOPMENT STATUS
There is no official release at the moment as it is not finished yet, even for a 0.1 release.
As it is developped under GNU/Linux, it is incompatible with MS Windows at the moment. I get back to this issue as soon as I have something satisfying. The same goes for the compilers. I develop it with gfortran, and I use some extensions to ease I/O (like getcwd). This will be fixed soon too.
